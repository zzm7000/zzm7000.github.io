<h2>Course Description</h2>
  <dd style="text-align: justify">
    <p style="text-align: justify">This course introduce students the basic ideas of the design principles, challenges, and solutions involved in building operating systems. An operating system serves as a middleware layer, acting as a critical interface between hardware and user applications. It abstracts the complexity of underlying hardware components and provides a consistent and efficient environment for applications to execute, without requiring direct management of low-level system details.

    To this end, the course also covers the C programming language and assembly language using the x86 architecture. Topics include virtual memory, the interface between assembly and high-level languages such as call frames and pointers, the use of system calls and systems programming to demonstrate interaction with the operating system, and the core structures of an operating system, including application interfaces, processes, threads, synchronization, interprocess communication, deadlock, memory management, file systems, and input/output control.

    The course emphasizes three core concepts fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. Through these principles, students gain practical knowledge of how operating systems perform tasks such as CPU scheduling, memory management, persistent file storage, interrupt handling, and input/output management.</p>

<h2>Reading Materials</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>We will use the free <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)</a> book by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau as our primary text for learning operating system concepts. Additionally, we will use the xv6 x86 version (<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/xv6/book-rev11.pdf">book revision 11</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">code</a>) as our implementation platform to study operating system internals. We we also be occasionally using the free online textbook <a href="https://diveintosystems.org/">Dive Into Systems</a>.</li>
      <li>Other books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3/dp/9332573905/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3 Edition</a></li> 
    </ul>

<h2>Exams</h2>

  <p>There will be no exams.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

  <p>This class is primarily programming-based. Therefore, you will mostly be judged on the quality and correctness of your code.</p>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>

  <p>Assignments turned in late will receive a 10% penalty per day after the deadline. One second after the deadline is one day late.</p>

<h2>AI Policy</h2>

  <p>The usage of generative AI models is allowed in this course under certain constraints, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Generative AI may be used to aid programming, but may not be used for writing or documentation.</li>
    <li>Any use of Generative AI must come with attribution including the specific model, date/time of use, and exact prompts. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism.</li>
    <li>Generative AI should be used not to get assignments done as quickly as possible but rather to facilitate learning.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Cheating Policy</h2>

  <p>It's ok to ask your peers about the concepts, algorithms, or approaches needed to do the assignments. We encourage you to do so; both giving and receiving advice will help you learn. However, what you turn in must be your own, or for projects, your group's own work. Looking at or copying code or homework solutions from other people or the Web is strictly prohibited. In particular, looking at other solutions (e.g., from other groups or students who previously took the course) is a direct violation. Projects must be entirely the work of the students turning them in, i.e., you and your group members. If you have any questions about using a particular resource, ask the course staff or post a question to the class forum. All students are subject to the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academichonesty.html">Northeastern University's Academic Integrity Policy</a>. Per Khoury College policy, all cases of suspected plagiarism or other academic dishonesty must be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR). This may result is deferred suspension, suspension, or expulsion from the university.</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>

  <p>If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic accommodations in this course and have not yet met with a Disability Specialist, please visit <a href="www.northeastern.edu/drc">www.northeastern.edu/drc</a> and follow the outlined procedure to request services. If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an academic accommodation in this class, please present the instructor with your “Professor Notification Letter” at your earliest convenience, so that we can address your specific needs as early as possible.</p>

<h2>Title IX</h2>

  <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/oidi/titleix/">here</a>.</p>
