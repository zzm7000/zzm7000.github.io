<h2>Review Guidelines</h2>

  <h3>High level guidance</h3>
  <dd style="text-align: justify">
    <p style="text-align: justify">Your judgement of the paper should be justified. For example, don't just say "interesting" or "unexciting." Explain why you think the paper has these qualities. Support your claims with examples.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Please DO NOT include "I am not an expert" or similar phrases. You are in a graduate cybersecurity class and you know something about cybersecurity. This is a good chance for you to practice. If there are things in the paper you do not understand, then read related papers and materials to understand.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Please be clear and constructive in your reviews. Imagine you are also helping the authors improve their paper.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Please be polite. Direct criticism towards the paper and NOT the authors; for example "the paper does not cite this important related work" would be received better than "the authors seems completely unaware of this important related work".</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Emphasis words like "very", in conjunction with flaws, often come across as demeaning/belittling/personal, and are usually not needed. (Consider "The methods are underspecified" versus "The methods are very underspecified"</p>
